TYPING RELAY RACE
=================

This is the official repository of the Typing Relay Race game from Group 1, of Distributed Systems Project 1, WS20/21. :)

G1-TRR PROTOCOL
===============

This short documentation specifies a protocol for the Typing Relay Race Client-Server communication.

MESSAGE TRANSFER
----------------

(1) Messages play important part in distributed communication systems. The G1-TRR standard follows a TLV protocol, which means that every message written to the socket is in the form of the Type Length Value.

There is only one Message type that is recognized by both the server and the client. The Message type has the following properties (1) isResponse (boolean), (2) reply (int), (3) payload (Object), (4) isError, where:

(1) isResponse [REQUIRED] - can be true or false, this gives both the client and the server the freedom to receive and send messages without without waiting for a response when is not needed.

(2) reply [REQUIRED] - a unique status code (check the STATUS CODES section below)

(3) payload [REQUIRED] - [TODO]

(4) isError [OPTIONAL] - [TODO]
